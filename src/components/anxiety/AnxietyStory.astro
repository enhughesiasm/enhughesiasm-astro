		Worrying was always what I did best. But eventually my worry habit

		went away.
	</div>
	<div>
		I spent months living with near-constant fear. Each night I lay awake,
		afraid of how I would feel the next day. There seemed to be no escape
		from this cycle. It seemed that the only way out might be something
		drastic.
	</div>
	<div>
		Naturally, I didn't actually üó£Ô∏è <em>tell anyone</em> about any of this. That
		would be silly üôÉ
	</div>
	<div>
		Finally, I couldn't tolerate it any longer. <span class='font-bold'

		something about it.

		<em>Walking on Custard</em> is a strange book, I'll freely admit, but it's
		the book I wished I could have read while I was struggling the most. It mixes
		personal stories, helpful advice gleaned from experts, and little tales about
		wizards and aliens. (Along with plenty of embarrassing stories about me,
		too.)
