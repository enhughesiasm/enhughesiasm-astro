		I spent months living with near-constant fear. Each night I lay awake,
		afraid of how I would feel the next day. There seemed to be no escape
		from this cycle. I feared the only way out would be something drastic.
		(Thinking about this possibility didn't help <em>at all</em>.)
	</div>
	<div>
		Naturally, I didn't actually <em>tell anyone</em> about any of this. That
		would be silly ðŸ™ƒ

		Finally, I couldn't tolerate it any longer. <span class='font-bold'

				<em>Walking on Custard</em> is an unusual book, but I wish I could
