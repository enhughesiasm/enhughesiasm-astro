			Everyone loves laughing. And we all know that humour is the best way
			to connect with audiences, to get them to retain the information you
			share... and to even ENJOY yourself while you&apos;re speaking in
			public!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>But being funny is hard.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			When jokes fall flat, self-doubt creeps in and that can derail your
			entire presentation. And heyâ€”it happens! But if there was a way to
			be confident that your next presentation will be more entertaining,
			wouldn&apos;t you want to get on board?

		I&apos;ve been amusing audiences since the early 2000s, when I sang a
		song about beans to a surprisingly enthusiastic crowd.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since then I&apos;ve performed everywhere from the Edinburgh Fringe
		Festival to my local shopping centre.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I give comedy talks about anxiety, including <a
			href='http://bit.ly/custardTED'
			class='font-bold text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-400'
			>this one</a
		>, which has been seen by over {TED_TALK_VIEWS.toLocaleString()} people!
	</p>

	<p>
		And I enjoy <strong>helping others be funny too</strong>.

		'His help was exactly what I needed to have confidence that the humour would come across.',
		"On the day, the laughs meant that people were really identifying with the situations I'd been in and seeing the funny side.  As this talk was about IT, I'd say that's an amazing skill Neil's got!",
