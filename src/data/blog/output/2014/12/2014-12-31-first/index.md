It's traditional\* for the first post on a new blog to be solely about the first post itself, and who am I to ignore Tradition?

_\* Well, probably traditional, though honestly I just made this up. It certainly sounds traditional enough for me._

Regarding the book, I'm optimistically hoping it will be out sometime in January. The current status is that the final proof-reading needs to be finished, the blurb needs to be finalised and added to the cover, and then I've got to prepare the formatting for both the print and e-book versions. Plus marketing and ISBN handling and all that delightful business.

I _think_ my Master To Do List contains everything, but I have been fooled into thinking that several times already, only to find that there is yet another step required.

I pessimistically expect to discover there are yet more forms I must send to mysterious companies for arcane reasons I barely understand.
