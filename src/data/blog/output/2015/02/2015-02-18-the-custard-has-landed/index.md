Okay, so "I hope to release during January" was _waaaay_ optimistic. Somehow I forgot that every single job takes way more time than you possibly imagined.

Anyway, the first print samples arrived today:

Exciting! There are some weird printing issues on a few pages, but I expect to get those resolved pretty quickly. It looks like the eventual release date will be late March/early April, which I think _morally_ counts as "early 2015", right?

As soon as I've got the release date set I'll be springing into action everywhere. I have a lot I've been planning to talk about here, but have been prioritising the work on finishing the book. I thought at Christmas that the manuscript was basically finished... how wrong I was.

Luckily, it now needs only very minor polish and the sorting of the printing problems, and then I'll be tackling my big list of topics for blogposts in the lead up to launch (and afterwards, of course).
