The [book](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/the-book-for-anxious-humans/ "The Book For Anxious Humans") is out!

Honestly, it was actually out two days ago. But somehow, amidst the madness, I never actually posted anything on my website.

The reaction has been positive so far - I've had some lovely enthusiastic comments from a few keen early readers. I'm looking forward to more people getting through it and letting me know what they think.

Meanwhile, do consider sharing the book around, encouraging people to check it out, and - of course - have a read of it yourself!

I can't wait to hear what you all think of it.

Talk to you all soon, and thanks so much for all the support and kind words you've sent. You're lovely.
