You may remember that aaaaages ago [I gave a TEDx talk](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/my-day-at-ted-x-leamington-spa/) about anxiety and custard.

Since then I've been asked "when is your TED video up?" approximately... a lot of times.

Finally, I can answer that question. (Although you've probably guessed.)

It's up now.

It contains me. Silly doodles. Stupid jokes. Honesty. Ideas about being less anxious. A malfunctioning slide clicker. And custard.

Watch it! (If you want.)

Hope you like it!
