## It's surprisingly easy to forget these things about ourselves:

<!--more-->

You have value.

It is inherent. It is part of you.

This value is not bestowed on you by others. Other's opinions about you are relevant... but they are _not_ relevant to what you are worth.

Your value is intrinsic. It cannot be taken away.

What you do does not change what you are worth. You may do great things; you may do bad things. Either way, you are of value.

(Doing great things adds value to _the world_, but not to _you_.)

You are neither more nor less valuable than anybody else.

Your worth is not based on material possessions. Whatever you _have_ does not affect whatever you _are_.

You do not have to be observed to have value. Even when you are alone, you are worth just the same as whenever you have company... whether they're praising you, laughing with you or arguing with you.

Nothing others do, say or believe changes your value.

People choosing to spend time with you - or not - does not affect your value.

Your beliefs about your worth do not affect your worth.

(It's more helpful to have positive beliefs, but _whatever you believe doesn't change the value itself_.)

Nothing you do, or have done, can change your value.

Your flaws - real or imagined - do not affect your value.

In fact, _your past_ does not affect your value.

Your _abilities_ do not affect your value.

Your _circumstances_ do not affect your value.

Your _role(s) in life_ do not affect your value.

Your _opinions_ - good, or terrible - do not affect your value.\*

Your _romantic success_ does not affect your value.

Your _sexual attractiveness_ does not affect your value.

Your _physical fitness_ does not affect your value.

_**\[x thing you are worrying about\]**_ does not affect your value.

Your value is yours, and nothing can change that.

\* (It's probably better to have good beliefs - true, loving, charitable, and so on. Believing this way can help to lead a happier life, and to create opportunities for happiness for the world. But even people who believe in false, hateful things have intrinsic value... even as they destroy the value they could be adding to the world.)
