Today, some **Incredibly Obvious Advice Which I Always Forget**.

You know those things you enjoy doing?

(Perhaps you don't. For me, modern life often turns into a kind of repetitive drudgery where days blend into one another. Even so, there's usually _something_ at some point lately which brought some joy. It's useful to notice "what's been fun, joyful, enjoyable, good lately" every now and then.)

Here's my suggestion: try and do more of those things you like.

Lately, I noticed that there were a few simple activities I had really enjoyed - meeting new people, live music, turning off social media - and I thought "I should probably do that more often".

And instead of ignoring that thought and just carrying on with my standard routines, I'm making an effort to consciously include more of those things in my life.

Even if the net result is a single extra coffee, or conversation with a friend, or one piece of music I wouldn't otherwise have listened to... even _just one extra thing I enjoy_ means my life is slightly happier as a result.

In case you want to use this **Incredibly Obvious Process**, it's this:

1. Recognise things you like

3. Do more of them

5. That's it.

Good luck!
