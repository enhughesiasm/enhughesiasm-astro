Last year my main achievement was writing a novel (which hopefully you'll all get to read sooner than later!), but otherwise I'm not even sure where 2017 went.

I feel like my life has been fairly static for a long time now, and while that's no bad thing, it feels like I need to shake things up.

I'm just not sure _how_, exactly... so I'm going to take time in January to chew over where I'm at and where I'd like to be.

Anyway, in the meantime, I wanted to share with you [this post](http://puttylike.com/the-awards-a-super-fun-and-insightful-way-to-review-your-year/) about my 'Awards' system for reviewing the year which just got published at Puttylike.

You might find it fun or interesting to try it yourself (and if you do, I'd love to hear how it works for you!)

Talk soon, once I've done some thinking :)
