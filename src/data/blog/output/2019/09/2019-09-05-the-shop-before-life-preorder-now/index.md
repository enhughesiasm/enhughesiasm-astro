![The Shop Before Life - book cover](images/SHOP_FRONT_FLAT.jpg)

Most people don't remember their visit to the Shop Before Life. Somehow, we forget the time we spent in the prelife, perhaps nervously traipsing through the long, dusty aisles of the Shop, choosing from countless jars of human traits while deciding who to become during our upcoming lives on Earth.  
But even if you don't remember your _own_ visit to the magical place which all humans visit before being born, you might remember the short story from [Walking on Custard](https://enhughesiasm.com/walking-on-custard) which was set there.  
  
**Either way, you might be excited to know that the world of the prelife is now ready for** _**you**_ **to explore.**

I _can't wait_ for you to meet the characters, discover the Shop and explore the prelife. There's all sorts of things to come: magical jars, a kindly Shopkeeper, ancient mysteries, huge, sprawling, beautiful gardens... and even _goats_.

And while you're counting down the days until October 28th 2019, why not [click here for more info, and a proper synopsis](https://enhughesiasm.com/sbl)!

_\* "available now" applies to MOST countries where readers of this site live, anyway. If it's not available for you right now, it will be soon... either ON October 28th 2019 or sometime BEFORE. Sign up at the [Occasional Email Experience](https://enhughesiasm.com/occasional-email-experience) if you want to be reminded._
