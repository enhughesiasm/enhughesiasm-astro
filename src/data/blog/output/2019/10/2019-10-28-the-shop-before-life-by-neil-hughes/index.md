" This is one of those books that I’m sure will stay with me for a while, if not for the rest of my life. There’s just something so unique and real about it and I just felt very connected to the themes it presented. " - [review](https://mymindspeaksaloud.wordpress.com/2019/10/28/the-shop-before-life-by-neil-hughes-gifted-book-review/)  
  
The day has finally arrived - **my new book has been released**! And I'm already delighted by the reactions from early readers. I hoped they'd enjoy the story, but I _really_ hoped they'd resonate with the questions about who we are, how we become who we are... and what this magical Shop has to do with all of it.

I hope you enjoy the story too.
