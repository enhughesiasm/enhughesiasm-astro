This talk contains me. Silly doodles. Stupid jokes. Honesty. Anxiety. Ideas about how to be less anxious. A malfunctioning slide clicker. And custard.

Despite some semi-comical mishaps that were (mostly) outside of my control, I'm really pleased with how it went. And, amazingly, over 100,000 people have seen it already!

I hope you enjoy it too :)

If you do, feel free to stick around and check out [what I've been writing about anxiety](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/category/anxiety/).

Originally this anxiety talk was uploaded as "Walking on Custard: How Physics Helps Anxious Humans", but the title got changed. I think both are fine.
