Neil is a comedian, physicist, anxiety sufferer and the author of ‘[Walking on Custard & the Meaning of Life](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/the-book-for-anxious-humans/)’, a unique combination of autobiographical confessions, humorous fantasy fiction, and a ‘how-to’ for managing anxiety & living a full, happy life.

As well as sharing about mental health, he is currently developing a comedy show, putting the finishing touches to a novel and perfecting the art of the pasta bake.

> Neil addressed a serious topic with a great sense of humour, putting us all at ease to discuss a subject that no one discusses openly in the workplace, and it prompted a very healthy and lively discussion. Great content and delivery – and good fun!Alicia Benito Martinez, [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development](http://ebrd.com/home)

## Events

Neil speaks at **schools, universities, conferences, businesses and groups of all kinds**, on a variety of topics, warmly sharing funny stories, unique observations and even practical tips for living a happy life. (Sometimes the tip is "don't do this stupid thing I did", sometimes it's more useful.)

WARNING: He may include an occasional comedy song. It's only fair you should be prepared for this possibility.

While Neil has a particular focus on the experience of anxiety, he's open to talking about a wide variety of topics, and enjoys exploring new ones with an audience.

Inner critic: You know, it's weird that this page is in the third person, but everywhere else on this site you just write normally. Why are you doing this?

Ssh, inner critic! This bit is _professional_.

Sort of.

> Neil related very well to the students with humorous stories and his down to earth humility. All took something away to think about for the future.[Fettes College, Edinburgh](http://www.fettes.com/)

## Fees

Of course, Neil prefers to eat, and so the question of fees usually arises at some point.

The exact fee is flexible, depending on the nature of the engagement, time required, and so on. And also depending on your means; please don't allow financial concerns to prevent you from asking for a quote.
