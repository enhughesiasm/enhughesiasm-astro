I've lived with anxiety for years. Here's a funny talk about it which many people have said helped them to feel less alone.

I also [wrote a funny book](https://enhughesiasm.com/woc), which goes into more detail about everything I learned from working through my anxiety. (And has a lot of embarrassing stories too.)

But I've also written many articles which may help. Everybody is in a different situation, but hopefully there's something useful here for you.
