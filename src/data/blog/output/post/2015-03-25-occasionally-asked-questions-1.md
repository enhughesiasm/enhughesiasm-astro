## Is this site just excerpts from the book?

The short answer is **"no"**.

The long answer is also no. But it has more detail:

Currently the site has **_zero_** excerpts from the book, and I intend to keep it that way.

I want to make the book and the site complementary to one another by producing all-new content for the site.

This also allows me to go beyond the scope of the book. Sometime after release I plan to start posting ideas that go further than the discovery of the Meaning of Life at the end of the book\*.

\* Sorry for spoilers, but it IS in the title...

Eventually, this site should provide both a gentle introduction to the initial steps of tackling anxiety, and also explore more advanced topics.

In the long term, I expect to solve the problems of World Peace and create a happy utopia for all humans.\*

\* (though this might take a while, and probably won't realistically happen.)

I hope that clears everything up, and thanks for your questions, nameless readers!
