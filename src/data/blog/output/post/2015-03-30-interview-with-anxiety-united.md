[Anxiety United](http://www.anxietyunited.co.uk) have posted their latest podcast episode, centred around an interview with me about the upcoming release of _Walking on Custard & the Meaning of Life_!

It was a really fun chat, and we got into discussion of mental health issues in general, as well as swapping some stories about our own experiences with anxiety.

And, listening back, I don't even hate the sound of my own voice too much!
