The one, single answer which will solve all my problems.

<!--more-->

I just need one last insight, and everything will click into place and make sense.

It must exist.

...

Occasionally somebody else has the one answer. They advertise it.

I need to learn it from them.

...

Sometimes I read the one answer in a book. It sinks into gaps in my brain like sand filling space around stones.

I've always known it to be true.

...

Sometimes I realise the one answer myself. I laugh.

Of course.

It was within me all along.

...

Each one answer fits... for a while.

I slot the final piece into place and complete the puzzle. At last, I can see _everything_.

But - selfishly - my problems scorn this clear and obvious truth. They don't appear to realise I've discovered the one answer which solves them all.

...

Sometimes when this happens I push my problems down deeply within, clinging desperately to my one answer.

It must be true. It must be enough.

Other times, I let go without a fight.

I need a new one answer.

...

No false answer has yet shaken my faith. The one answer must exist.

...

I change my diet; I change my routine; I think positive thoughts; I convert my religion; I fix my relationship; I rebuild my environment; I meditate; I alter my beliefs; I love myself.

None of those were the one answer.

...

You might wonder - did those false answers not help? Did none of them bring any improvement?

And, if I noticed, I might say that yes, they did. Each made a contribution. Each helped.

But do not distract me from my search.

I don't want many hard answers. I want any easy answer.

...

I'll find the one answer yet.
