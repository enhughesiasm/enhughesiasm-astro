I've been travelling.

I had great plans to work while I travelled. I've done _some_, but mostly I've failed to be the super-productive me I envisioned. Staying on top of food, sleep, exercise, seeing people, seeing places, adventures AND work was always going to be hard.

I haven't written several posts for this blog (albeit some are sorta drafted). I haven't finished the draft of a book (although I've made progress). I haven't sent my guaranteed-hilarious\* mailing list email.

\* not actually guaranteed

And you know what? The world isn't ending.

I will have to catch up. But the level of guilty anxiety I've had over this perceived failure is - as usual - way out of proportion.

Especially when I step back and look at reality: I've done a LOT in a few weeks, especially considered I've had to handle some sad circumstances at home along with a few setbacks over here. If anything, I ought to be _impressed_ with how I've handled everything, instead of beating myself up for failing to magic an extra five hours into every day to write a whole book as well.

Possibly there's a wider lesson here, but as usual it's the same lesson: [changing my perspective](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/novelty-blindness-fresh-perspectives/) by [looking again at reality](https://www.walkingoncustard.com/the-world-in-our-heads/) is very, very helpful.
