Occasionally I wonder if I should post something of absolutely zero value, in order to demonstrate that it's okay to do something totally rubbish and with zero effort from time-to-time.

<!--more-->

(I think a cynical part of me genuinely sees a possible niche for myself: providing a helpfully low bar for everybody else to clear.)

The moral of this Deliberately Bad Post would be "sometimes it's okay to just show up" or "even a bad post is better than no post", or something like that.

But then I think about it, and realise this idea might accidentally have the opposite effect than intended. By definition, my deliberately lazy bad post would be - and this is important to recognise - **bad**.

And it seems unlikely that anybody is going to look at an awful post and think "wow, that sucks... now I feel inspired!"

I can see how that would be possible in theory, but the truth is that it takes a lot of effort to make a good bad post. It's like a good-bad film... most bad films are just terrible, while creating something so-bad-its-good requires years of work.

And so I haven't yet attempted to write a post that's _deliberately_\* low effort and bad.

This one is just bad because I'm tired.

Honest.

\* this is an important distinction

## The Moral(s) of this Post

Choose your own:

- Sometimes it's okay to just show up

- Even a bad post is better than no post

- Pointing out that a post is lazy doesn't make it not lazy

- Laziness is fine...

- ... sometimes

- But it doesn't matter much anyway

- We should all relax a bit and take the pressure off ourselves

- Still, though, I COULD have tried harder

- Sorry
