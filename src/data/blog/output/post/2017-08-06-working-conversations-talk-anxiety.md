You might be interested in [this talk](https://stream.liv.ac.uk/fcepbcy2) I was invited to give recently at the University of Liverpool.

The occasion was "Working Conversations", a conference intended to discuss what a better mental health service might look like.

I was invited to share my experiences with anxiety, some thoughts about custard, and to throw open a few questions for the 'proper' experts to consider during their discussions for the rest of the day.

Hopefully I did an alright job! You can see the talk [via this link](https://stream.liv.ac.uk/fcepbcy2).

**I'm very interested in your feedback, so please do let me know what you make of it!**
