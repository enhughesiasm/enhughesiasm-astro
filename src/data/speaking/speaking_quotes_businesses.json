Neil created a lasting impression on the audience through his incredible humour and helpful advice while depicting everything you need to know about multipotentiality. He spoke about his own life story and real life case studies that demonstrated how to utilize your multiple talents and skills to develop your dream career. Neil spoke about dealing with the feelings of anxiety when it comes to failure and reminded students to choose to view success when it comes to doing what you love. Despite the event taking place virtually, he was still able to reveal his ideas and witty personality through the screen, instantly becoming the fan-favourite at the event!. When asked about thoughts on his presentation, a Trent graduate student said, 'Great! I related strongly to the topics presented. Well spoken and funny.' Another Trent graduate student said, 'Really loved this talk, I thought he had such an interesting perspective and I think he's convinced me to embrace my inner multipotentialite!!!'",
